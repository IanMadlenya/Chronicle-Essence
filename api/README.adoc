= Essence API
Peter Lawrey

This API forms the basis of all common services including

- service discovery
- transport discovery

=== Service Discovery

Services can be discovered by a combination of a name and type.
The proxy returned by the service discovery must support the interface provided.
The ultimate remote service might not support all or any of the methods in the type.

ServiceRegistry registry = new VanillaServiceRegistry();

MyService ms1 = new MyService();

registry.put("service1", ms1);

=== Transport/Infrastructure Discovery

Transports can be used to access remote services. You can obtain a transport to a particular Endpoint.
